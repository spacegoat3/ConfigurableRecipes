<p>If you want to enable/disable recipes from the Configurable Recipes, you can use the <strong>"configurable_recipes.json5"</strong> or the <strong>"Mod Menu Mod"</strong>.</p>

## Configuring Recipes Trough File

<p>You can configure the recipes trough a <strong>".json5 file"</strong>. A text based file type. It can be found in <strong>".minecraft\config".</strong> To reach this file you can do the following steps.</p>

<p>1 - Write <strong>"%appdata%"</strong> to your desktop research bar.</p>
<p>2 - Open <strong>".minecraft"</strong> folder.</p>
<p>3 - Open <strong>"config"</strong> folder. If there isn't one, run Minecraft with Configurable Recipes installed, the folder will be created automatically.</p>
<p>4 - Open the <strong>"configurable_recipes.json5"</strong></p>

It should look like this:
